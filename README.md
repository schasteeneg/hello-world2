This is my hello world1 repository

My name is Gary. I am 40 years old, and am learning to code! So far, I have been working through Python courses on Udemy, and 
have also worked through Udemy courses to learn how to code in Unity 3D, and to code for virtual reality for the HTC Vive, Gear VR, 
Google Cardboard, and will be learning to code for other VR headsets! 

Coding is fun!

I have a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics, and so coding is not new to me. But I want to really refine my coding skills!

My interest in VR is to develop VR Content to be used in education, and to be used as a tool for ... well who knows! 
The potential applications of Virtual Reality beyond gaming are nearly limitless! Part of the journey will be learning
how to develop VR tools for specific applications and needs, and to do so quickly and efficiently. With ma-ny of the 
packages being developed, it is now possible for a single person working on their own budget to code up 
some amazing functionality in VR extremely quickly, and with little monetary cost. The major cost at this point is 
the initial equipment purchase cost ~ 2800 for an HTC Vive together with a gaming pc powerful enough to run it, and 
the time spent learning to code specifically for VR. 

This is a living document that may change!

That's it for now, wish all who read this well, even if it is just me!

Gary
